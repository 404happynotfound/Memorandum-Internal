            <h1 class="bold">I Love You ... Really!</h1>
            <p class="message">I love you. I love you from the very deepest part of my heart. You are almost perfect in every way that matters. Sometimes I feel like even a million “I love you” would never be enough to express the size of my love for you. My feelings for you are bigger than language, fuller than any sentence, and softer than anything I could ever say out loud.</p>
            <p class="message">Your eyes ... they are beautiful in a way that quiets the world. Your eyes are as breathtaking as a silent night that calms the restless heart. Your hair, thick and soft like cotton, is something I could lose myself in without ever wanting to return. Your voice, gentle as a feather, wraps around me with the warmth of something familiar and safe. Everything about you—your presence, your warmth, your softness—holds a beauty that leaves my heart beating faster every time the thought of you crosses my mind. I love every little thing about you, even the parts you think go unnoticed.</p>
            <p class="message">There is a quiet perfection in you—something so natural, so effortless, that it feels as though the universe took its time shaping you. You carry a kind of beauty that doesn't ask to be seen yet becomes impossible to ignore, a near-perfect harmony of softness and depth that makes me fall for you over and over again.</p>
            <p class="message2">"I Love You."</p>
            <p class="message">Those words made my heart burst open—like a flower blooming in the heat of summer, not from a gentle breeze, but from a sudden warm gust that sends a shock through my chest and sets my pulse racing. Your words sank into me so quickly, like a flash of light that strikes fast yet leaves a lingering warmth I can't shake off. Even if you said it playfully, I took it as something real, something that mattered. From your lips, those simple words became something electric—something that jolts me sweetly and makes my heart thrum every time I remember them.</p>
            <p class="message">You are so patient with me. You meet my flaws with kindness, and you have never raised your voice or let anger take its place between us. Thank you for being here in my life, for choosing to stay, for giving me the comfort of your love. I'm sorry for the moments I've troubled you, for the times when my emotions overflowed clumsily. I never mean to burden you—everything I do, everything I say, comes from love, from wanting to express what I feel, from wanting your attention because you mean that much to me. I hope your love and the tenderness you show me will never fade, because they are among the most precious things I've ever had.</p>
            <p class="message">Happy birthday, my love. Please stay healthy. Seeing you unwell is something that breaks me quietly every time. Accept this simple gift from me. I made all of it sincerely, with every bit of effort and every piece of love I have. It may be small, but my heart is in every part of it.</p>
            <p class="message">Once again, happy birthday, my dearest love, Hengky. I love you—deeply, endlessly, and in ways words will never fully hold.</p>
            <p class="message">Your precious girlfirend, H</p>
